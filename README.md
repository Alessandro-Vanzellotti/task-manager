## Task manager

Welcome to my application!! This task manager has features such as task creation, edition, deletion and search. For the frontend of this applications I used 
React.js, Typescript, HTML and SASS. For the backend I used Node.js and, as the database, MongoDB.

To run the server for the api, open the terminal, go to the folder "server" and run the command "npm start".
To run the frontend, open the terminal, go to the folder "task-manager" and run the command "npm run dev".

If everything goes according to plan, you should see this:
